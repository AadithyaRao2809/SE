#### Matrix Multiplication with MapReduce

Vertical split of matrix is better as we dont have to hit entire vector in memory

#### Page Rank

- Cannot use term frequency
- Cannot simply use number of incoming links
- start from a random page and start traversing ; probability of reaching a page from a random page using links (random surfer)

##### Map reduce implementation
Mapper stage outputs(k,v) pairs where key is name ofthe page (index in vector v) and value is the transition probability âœ— the initial value in v
