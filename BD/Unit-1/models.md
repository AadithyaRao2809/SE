- **Modelling Pipeline**: Input data ➔ Model ➔ Analysis
- **Big Data Themes**:
  1. Manage large data (e.g., Google search engine)
  2. Extract value and knowledge (e.g., recommendation systems)
- **Machine Translation**:
  - Translation approaches: Traditional vs. Big data
  - Traditional approach: Rule-based with structure understanding
  - Big data approach: Analyzing patterns from large data, less reliance on domain knowledge
- **Pitfalls**:
  1. Spurious Correlation: Be cautious when a correlation between variables may not imply causation.
  2. Gaps in Data: Biased or incomplete data can lead to inaccuracies.
- **Error Checking of Models**:
  - All data contains signal (useful) and noise (irrelevant/erroneous).
  - Models trained on training data, errors estimated on testing data.

In relation to big data, these concepts highlight the significance of managing and extracting insights from vast data volumes, as well as the challenges and precautions necessary when working with extensive and potentially noisy datasets. Big data techniques enable organizations to harness valuable information from such data, but they also require careful consideration and validation to ensure accurate results.
