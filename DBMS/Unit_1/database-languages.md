# Database Languages

## Data definition Language (DDL)
- Used to define structure or pattern
- Creates schemas, indexes
- Processing of DDL generates output that is stored in a data dictionary
- Concerned with schema, integrity and authorization

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Procedural - what to get and how to get it Eg. COBOL
- Declarative - only what to get. Eg. SQL
- Concerns with retrieval insertion, deletion and modification.
- uses queries to request data retrieval.
- Not Turing complete, needs to be embedded in higher level language.
- API allows SQL queries to be sent to a DB. Eg. ODBC(Open Database Connectivity), JDBC(Java Database Connectivity).
