# Decision Boundaries

When there are many attributes, we can represent a data point as a point in n-dimensional space, where there are n attributes. When there is a need to classify data into clusters, we need to define boundaries in this space. 




Linear boundaries are when an (n-1) dimensional space is used as the boundary. data that can be separable like this is called linearly separable data.

Non linear Boundaries are when the boundary is a curve
