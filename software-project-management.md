A good project has a balance between Scope, Time and Cost. All These contribute toward the quality of the project.

##### Execution Stakeholder (Development Team)

#### Stages to Project Planning

**Understanding expected Deliverables**

- market forces (new tech, competition)
- high level decisions (make, buy or reuse)
- Supported by Feasibility study and Requirements elicitation

**Planning the Process**
- Choice of lifecycle - depends on degree of uncertainty (certainity->legacy)
- Models, Standards(technical, interoperability, quality, regulatory), guidelines, procedures(config, quality plan, change management)

**Organizing Project**
- Structure - in terms of people, team, responsibilities (heirarchical, flat, functional, matrix, line org)
