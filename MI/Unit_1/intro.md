# Introduction

<b><u>Artificial intelligence:</u></b> A computer program that emulates human behaviour.

<b><u>Machine learning</u></b> An algorithm that uses data to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.

<u>Turing Test</u> A test originally designed to distinguish humans and AI  programs, it is an AI's goal to pass the Turing test.

**Types of ML**
- Supervised 
- Unsupervised
- Semi-supervised
- Reinforcement 

**Narrow AI**      Performs a very specific task and is only good at that task. Eg. Thermostat
**General AI**     Close to how humans behave, if not on par with humans. 
**Super AI**        Surpasses the intellectual capabilities of humans.

# Agent
Takes decisions based on changes in the environment.
**Intelligent Agent:** autonomous entities that use sensors to observe changes in the environment. Eg. autonomous driving

**Rational Agent:** Has a single task and tries to maximize progress towards a goal
<u>Characterizing Intelligent Agent</u>
- Performance Measure
- Environment
- Actuators
- Sensors

For autonomous Driving Performance Measure is speed, comfort, fuel efficiency. Environment consists of other cars, pedestrians, road signs and roads. Sensors are the RADAR, LiDAR sensors and the cameras mounted. The actuators are the throttle, breaks, and the steering control.

#### <u>Types of Agents:</u> 

**Single Reflex:** Performs an action based solely on the current state, does not depend on the previous state or actions.

**Model Based:** keeps a history of actions and states and uses this information to take decisions.

**Goal Based:** decisions take by the agent are towards a goal, and the agent is rewarded for getting closer to a goal. The reward system affects its decision making making.

**Utility Based:** Other than the main goal, other optimisations are also rewarded.

**Learning agents:** Agents that learn from their past experience. They don't have any data to work with.



# Environment
## Properties of Environment
**Observability:** If ans agent can observe every aspect of the environment, it is called fully observable, whereas if the agent can only know of part of the environment, it is partially observable.

**Determinism:** If the agent knows every possible change in the environment, it is deterministic.

**Episodicity:** If the actions taken by the agent does not affect its future actions, it is episodic, or else it is sequential.

**Staticity:** If the environment is constantly changing without the action of the agent it is dynamic, else it is static.
