# Matchings and Coverings

### Matchings
set of edges where no two edges share vertices.

**Maximal Matching** matching to which no new edge can be added 
A matching where all vertices are reachable.

**Complete matching in bipartite** V1 into V2 exists if there is an integer m for which deg of V1 >= m >= deg of V2,
